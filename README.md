Title of our project:  Who Loves Coffee?  An synopsis of the retail coffee industry's popularity in the United States.

Our project will delve into a high level review of the retail coffee business.  Our goal is to examine the popularity of coffee as a beverage and people's overall reaction towards the bean.

This very high level overview of the retail coffee business will look at the following aspects: populairty, acceptance, and viability of the retail coffee market.  All analysis based on datasets obtained from Yelp.com, to see how coffee shops have become upbiquitous in our culture.

Yelp provided datasets for only seven cities: Portland, OR; Boulder, CO; Austin, TX; Orlando, FL, Columbus, OH; Atlanta, GA; and Boston, MA.  All of our datasets were cleaned using Python, some were converted into the following formats: Excel, CSV, JSON, and geoJSON.

All of our codes were written in all or some of the following languages: Python, Javascript, HTML, and/or Javascript.  In our project we incorporated Flask, Javascript libraries: APEXCHARTS, Leaflet, CanvasJS, and ChartsJS.
